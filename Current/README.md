# Current Bot Code

### Two Code Files:
<li><strong>ThanOS</strong> is the most up to date code for the v4 Bot
<li><strong>Snap</strong> is the most up to date code for the v5 Bot

Notes.md is a changelog for the code, and a place for discussing any changes or suggesting changes.

### I'm no longer in Robotics and never got around to coding for the v5 bot.  Feel free to poke around at the v4 code though.
